wii-u-gc-adapter MiSTER
================
Just compiled ToadKing's wii-u-gc-adapter to work on the MiSTER and included a simple startup script.

SSH into your MiSTER and place the folders on root  
(You can put the executable anywhere, doesnt need to be in the home directory, just modify the user_startup.sh as needed)  
Run chmod u+x FILE_HERE on both 'wii-u-gc-adapter' and 'user_startup.sh' if not done already
